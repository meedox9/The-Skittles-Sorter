# The-Skittles-Sorter
The Skittles Separator illustrates some of the basic fundamentals of C++ programming language elements implemented into a microcontroller, the Arduino Uno. This project consists of a mechanism that is able to separate Skittles candy based on color into designated compartments. The project is also programmed to keep track of how many skittles of each color were passed through a color sensor. The user places a random sample of skittles into a funnel on the top of the machine and then the machine is initiated via turning a rotary dial and the separation process begins. This project applies both software and hardware engineering attributes.
